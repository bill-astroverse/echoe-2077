# Unity Web3 NFT Character System

This project demonstrates how to integrate NFT characters into a Unity game using Web3 technology. Players can own, level up, and transfer their game characters as NFTs on the blockchain.

## Key Features

1. **NFT Character Ownership**: Characters exist as NFTs on the blockchain
2. **Wallet Integration**: Connect to MetaMask or other Web3 wallets
3. **Character Management**: Mint, transfer, and update NFT characters
4. **Game Integration**: Use NFT characters in your Unity game

## Implementation Details

### Smart Contract

The `GameCharacterNFT.sol` contract is an ERC-721 NFT contract with additional functionality for storing character stats and attributes. Game studios can be authorized to update character stats when players progress in the game.

### Unity Integration

The Unity integration consists of several components:

1. **Web3Manager**: Handles blockchain interactions and wallet connections
2. **NFTCharacter**: Represents an NFT character in the game
3. **NFTCharacterFactory**: Creates and manages character instances
4. **UI Components**: Interfaces for wallet connection, character inventory, minting, and transfers

## Setup Instructions

1. Deploy the `GameCharacterNFT.sol` contract to your preferred blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
2. Update the `Web3Manager.cs` script with your contract address and ABI
3. Set up the Unity scene with the required prefabs and UI elements
4. Test the integration with a Web3 wallet

## Usage Flow

1. Player connects their wallet using the WalletConnectUI
2. Player's NFT characters are loaded and displayed in the inventory
3. Player selects a character to use in the game
4. As the player progresses, character stats are updated on the blockchain
5. Player can mint new characters or transfer existing ones to other players

## Best Practices

- Cache blockchain data to minimize network requests
- Implement proper error handling for blockchain operations
- Use events to keep the UI in sync with blockchain state
- Consider gas costs when designing update frequency

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-chain support
- Character equipment as separate NFTs
- Marketplace integration for trading characters
- Cross-game character compatibility
